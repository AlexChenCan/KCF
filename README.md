# KCF
the KCF tracker's python version implementation


### Requirements
- Python 3.6
- NumPy
- OpenCV-Python (ensure that you can `import cv2` in python)

### Problem
In the Kcf paper, Author used the fhog feature in matlab code. I don't find the python implementation of fhog, so this code is not include fhog feature, just used gray and  rgb feature. I will try to add the fhog feature implementation.
